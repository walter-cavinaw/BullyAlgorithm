I tested my bully implementation on two other groups implementation. These were z1t7(james) and
k8a9_v9c9(ken and stuart). When running just against james, we had two ndoes running each.
Our nodes worked perfectly together and were able to switch back and forth being coordinator
when we started and stopped one of our nodes. This was great to see after spending so much time on it.
When running against stuart and ken the system was able to run, as long as they were not the coordinator.
If one of their nodes became the coordinator, they encountered some errors. I believe they were working
on fixing that, last I heard.
