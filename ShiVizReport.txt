The example I provided is off a group of 5 nodes. That is somewhat interesting that they are able
to identify the coordinator because it is so complex. When we first started this assignment, I had doubts
I would even be able to do it.
There is something beautiful about the visualization for it this group. The messages that are being sent
back and forth look like a complex system, but there are only five nodes. It makes you think about
the other networks we deal with on a daily basis.

I want to talk about some of the other experiences I had that led to interesting results. In the early
stages of the implementation, I had a situation arise that caused me quite a bit of confusion.

Whenever a node discovered that it would be the coordinator, it would declare it to all nodes that.
But soon after, that same node would start an election. I discovered that it would declare "I am the 
coordinator!" and then get that same message from itself. Then it checks if the node ID of that message
is greater than its own node ID. Obviously it can't be greater than itself. So every timeout*(maxnodes+1)
it would find out it is the coordinator and then start an election. Luckily enough this did not affect
the other nodes. They were oblivious to this and just kept sending AYA messages.
